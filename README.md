# Delhi_Weather
A data science mini-project on the weather in Delhi done by Gourav, Deepthi, Dev Darshan and Bhargav Narayanan P.  
We found this dataset from kaggle whose data is extracted from a commercial weather service website (wunderground) with the help of their API's.  
The selected dataset records the weather in Delhi throughout the years 1997-2017.
  
We have used 3 collab notebooks with the links to each being provided here.
